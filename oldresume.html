                <p><strong>Sales Consultant</strong>, Leichhardt Volkswagen, December 2020 - December 2021</p>
                <p>Having left JB to pursue a career in Car Sales I found myself at Leichhardt Volkswagen with an
                    amazing team and manager in Jenna Yorkston and Clive Sellars who has taught me a great deal
                    about the industry and the sales process, coming from a previous sales role I knew coming in the
                    experience would be different than my previous role but I was ready to take on the challenge and
                    give it my all, I'm proud to say I have fully come into my role here learn more and more about the
                    sales process and customer relations.</p>

                <p>My time at JB Hi-Fi has brought me many skills sets that I've acquired over the years, initially starting
                    off in the media section, I gained the skill set necessary for cash register service as well as visual
                    merchandising, then moving into the sales section I then gained the skill set to properly inform
                    customers about products and current trends and upcoming products they find useful, the ability
                    to find the right product for a customer is something I especially excel at</p>
